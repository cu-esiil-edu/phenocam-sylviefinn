# ESA 2025 Workshop

This is a repository for the [PhenoCam](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/) workshop presented at the [2025 Ecological Society of America meeting](https://esa.org/baltimore2025/) held in Baltimore, MD in August 2025. Material includes instructions about how to access PhenoCam data and imagery directly from the website (via API), and how to create greenness timeseries plots, as well as a photo layout and gif showing seasonal changes in a PhenoCam site over the course of a year.

Instructions about how to use this code can be found on the [ESIIL Learning Portal](https://earthdatascience.org/notebooks/07-phenocam/phenocam-esa.html).
